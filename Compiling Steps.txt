Requirements / Packages Needed
1. g++ [C++ compiler]
2. libstdc++X-X.X-dev [X -- version numbers] (should have been installed with 1, just in case something happened)
3. libx11-dev [Not really required, but because of how LEDA library is distributed]

STEP 1: Modify Environment variables to include LEDA headers & libs
--Open up the terminal & type the following
gedit ~/.bashrc

--Copy the following contents and paste it at the end of the file (Modify LEDAROOT env variable if needed )

# configuration for LEDA
LEDAROOT=~/LEDA
export LEDAROOT

CPATH=$CPATH:$LEDAROOT/incl
export CPATH

LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:$LEDAROOT
export LIBRARY_PATH

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LEDAROOT
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

--Save the file and exit gedit. Restart the terminal

STEP 2: Compile the program.
g++ filename -o outputfilename -lleda -lX11

Eg: g++ bi-directional_dijkstra.cpp -o dijk -lleda -lX11

STEP 3: Thats it. Run the program
./outputfilename

Eg: ./dijk
